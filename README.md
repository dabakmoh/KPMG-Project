# KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship


## INTRODUCTION
The KPMG Data Analytics Virtual Internship is a practical opportunity for me to gain insight into the work done at KPMG and to build career skills and experience. In this simulation, I take on the role of a data analyst working with Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a medium-sized bikes and cycling accessories organization, to explore KPMG's expertise in Analytics, Information, and Modelling.

## PROJECT OVERVIEW
The project is divided into three main tasks:

### Task 1: Data Quality Assessment
**Objective:** Evaluate data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis.

**Datasets Provided by the Client:**
1. Customer Demographic
2. Customer Addresses
3. Transactions data

**Approach:**
I conducted preliminary data exploration to identify areas for improvement in Sprocket Central Pty Ltd's data.

### Task 2: Data Insights
**Objective:** Target high-value customers based on customer demographics and attributes.

**Approach:**
I started with a PowerPoint (PPT) presentation outlining my approach.
I developed a detailed approach, including activities such as understanding data distributions, data transformations, modeling, and reporting, primarily using the PPT file for documentation.

### Task 3: Data Insights and Presentation
**Objective:** Use Power BI to create visualizations and present insights to the client.

**Approach:**
I created a dashboard using Power BI to display data summaries and analysis results.
Key questions addressed during the presentation included:
- What trends are present in the underlying data?
- Which customer segment holds the highest customer value?
- What marketing and growth strategy should Sprocket Central Pty Ltd consider?
- What additional external datasets could enhance our understanding of customer preferences and purchase propensity?
